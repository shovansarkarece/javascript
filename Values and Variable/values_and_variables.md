- **In JavaScript, values and variables are fundamental concepts that form the basis of programming.**
# Values:  
- **A value is a piece of information that a program can work with. It can be a number, text, true/false, or more complex data.**
# Variables: 
- **A variable is a container that holds a value. It has a name and can be used to store and manipulate data in a program.**
#### Example-1
```
var myAge = 30;
// console.log(myAge);
```
#### Example-2
```var my_firstName = "John";```
- **Explanation: This is a valid variable name. It starts with a letter, and the subsequent characters include letters, numbers, and an underscore. Follows JavaScript naming rules.**
#### Example-3
```var _myLastName$ = "Doe";```
- **Explanation: This is a valid variable name. It starts with an underscore, and the subsequent characters include letters, numbers, and a dollar sign. Follows JavaScript naming rules.**
#### Example-4
```var 123myAge = 25;```
- **Explanation: This is not a valid variable name. It starts with a number, which is not allowed as per JavaScript naming rules. Variable names cannot begin with a digit.**
#### Example-5
```var $cityName = "New York";```
- **Explanation: This is a valid variable name. It starts with a dollar sign, and the subsequent characters include letters. Follows JavaScript naming rules.**
#### Example-6
```var my@Email = "john@example.com";```
- **Explanation: This is not a valid variable name. It includes the special character '@', which is not allowed in JavaScript variable names. Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs are allowed.**
